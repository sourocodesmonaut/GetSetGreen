The problem GetSetGreen solves
The core idea and objective of the project:
Vehicle emissions are a major contributor to environmental pollution and climate change, with far-reaching consequences for the planet and human society. We intend to have a seamless paradigm shift from combustion 
engine based vehicle to electric vehicle provided only the vehicles with higher emission rates are eliminated from roads and the ones meeting the emission check criteria are permitted

Summary of what has been accomplished:
The program so developed until now from the hackathon beginning is capable of extracting car license number from number plate of the car and search for the car details in database which as of now is static csv file 
and display the same info to user while prompting for greenest navigation route between any two cities as selected by user.

The current functionality and features implemented:
We have utilised OpenCV(Open Computer Vision) library for object detection in captured image, Imutils for extracting layout of the image and sorting contours after edge detection, Matplotlib module to display 
captured image, EasyOCR for text recognition and extraction, CSV module imported for comma seperated values list of car model and information and also list of starting point to destination.
